# Hey there üëã, I'm Abdessalem Mami

I'm currently an **artificial intelligence engineering student**, a **web developer** and a **co-founder** at [DeepFlow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepflowesprit/){:target="_blank"}, an AI student club at ESPRIT.


## Education üéì 

Graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Higher Institute of Informatics of El Manar was an exciting journey that provided me with a strong foundation in computer systems, programming, and software development. During my time there, I gained a deep understanding of critical computer science concepts such as operating systems, algorithms, data structures, networks, and security. In addition, I was able to develop my skills in areas such as computer architecture, databases, and software conception. In my last year there, I was introduced to the field of Artificial Intelligence, and I was immediately drawn to its limitless potential to revolutionize industries and improve people's lives. This introduction sparked a passion and curiosity within me that has led me to pursue an engineer's degree in Artificial Intelligence at ESPRIT School of Engineering. Here, I have been able to further explore my passion for AI and expand my knowledge in various topics such as programming with Python and R, statistics & probabilities, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data engineering, model deployment, agile methodologies and frameworks for AI projects, Markov Decision Process, generative models, reinforcement learning and more..


## Experience üíº

I have had the opportunity to intern with several companies. Through these internships, I have been able to apply my academic knowledge to real-world situations, and gain valuable hands-on experience.

One of my internships was with Advences, where I worked as a Web Development Intern. During this experience, I improved user profile functionalities by redesigning and implementing view and modify user profile features within a financial management platform that allows companies to create financial reports and manage requests for quotations from third-party organizations. 

Another internship that I completed was with SPX (currently known as KPMG - Tech Solutions), where I worked as a Web Development Intern. In this role, I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to identify requirements and set milestones for the development of a Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) web application in the framework of my bachelor's degree final project. I designed and implemented the application's database architecture in collaboration with the project team, and also facilitated and digitized the business process of managing quality incident costs between the company and its suppliers by designing and developing a cost management module within the SRM application. 

Finally, I worked as a Machine Learning Intern at SASLab. During my time there, I designed and implemented an Emotion Recognition System (ERS) for facial expressions and speech using Deep Learning. I was also responsible for building a backend application server to deploy the ERS models, as well as creating a user-friendly mobile application to capture facial expressions and speech and recognize emotions. 

Overall, my internships have allowed me to gain experience with a wide range of tools and technologies, as well as to develop my problem-solving and collaboration skills. I am excited to continue building on this experience as I pursue my career in AI engineering.

## Interests ‚ú®

I have always been committed to pursuing opportunities for learning and expanding my knowledge, whether it be through reading, attending conferences and workshops, or pursuing further education. It is not just about staying current and relevant in my field, but also about enriching my life and discovering new passions and interests. As an example, I have actively sought out and participated in various summer schools, events, and university-organized visits ([MASSAI](https://massai.esprit.tn/){:target="_blank"}, WEITA, Job fairs, [Riyeda](https://www.se.tn/){:target="_blank"}, ...) as well as competing in numerous African and national machine learning hackathons such as [AI HACK Tunisia](https://ai-hack-tunisia.com/){:target="_blank"} by InstaDeep and Google, [UmojaHack](https://umojahack.africa/){:target="_blank"} by Zindi, ...)

In addition, I am passionate about sharing knowledge with others and helping to foster a community of like-minded individuals. To this end, I have co-founded a university club dedicated to building a community of passionate students interested in Artificial Intelligence. Our goal is to provide students with the foundation and resources they need to pursue their interests in this field. I invite you to visit the activities page of this website to learn more about my involvement in these and other related initiatives.
