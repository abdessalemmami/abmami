<h2 style="margin-top:0px">My Projects</h2>

My projects are carried out in the context of my academic studies, and also during my internships at companies. A variety of tools, technologies, and methodologies have been used, but they mainly include machine learning workflows from business understanding to deploying models, and software development with more focus on web-based & mobile applications and systems.

ðŸ‘‰ Here's a list of my projects below, but if you want to get more information about a specific project, you can always visit the blog post related to it where it's more detailed.

## Video Insights Application (Work In Progress)

The application leverages natural language processing techniques and models to analyze the audio of a video and identify patterns, trends, and key insights. It also provides a comprehensive overview of the video content such as sentiment analysis, summarization, topics, entities, etc..

## Tunisian Sign Language Transcription

In Tunisia, deaf people do not have that many options for communicating with a hearing person in the field of healthcare, and all of the alternatives do have major flaws, interpreters arenâ€™t usually available, and also could be expensive. My team and I created an easy-to-use web application that we called "ESMAANI". This app works by placing a web camera in front of the deaf person while the application translates sign language gestures into text. This application can transcribe the Tunisian Sign Language as quick as the person speaks. We've used computer vision algorithms and other deep learning techniques to recognize the Tunisian Sign language in real-time, and then translate it into text.

## Emotionly 

This project is about designing and building an emotion recognition system to be deployed
on a mobile application. This system aims to identify human emotions from facial expressions and
speech audio samples. In this work, I conceived a mobile application for an experimental
purpose. However, I also intended to build an emotion recognition system that can operate for
various purposes and easily integrate with existing services. One of its applications is to offer better
recognition of other human emotions leading to effective communication in a commercial context. In
fact, automatic human emotion recognition has received much attention recently thanks to the fast
advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Thus, I implemented machine
learning algorithms and approaches to build this system.

## TuringCare

TuringCare is a web application that enables disease response by providing an easy management and access to patient information at one place. This application also allows healthcare professionals to detect lung diseases (Covid-19, Tuberculosis, Viral Pneumonia) in Chest X-Ray images and link results to patients' records. The TuringCare app uses deep learning algorithms to classify diseases and interpret abnormalities in the lungs from Chest X-Ray images.

## Supplier Relationship Management Application

This project consists of developing a web application that provides an online platform for collaboration between a company and its suppliers in different business processes, such as the management of quality incidents, complaint reports, suppliers database, and declarations of costs. In this project, my task was to the develop a cost management module within the context of the SRM application. This module involves the management of costs related to quality incidents and actions resulting from defective goods delivered by suppliers.
